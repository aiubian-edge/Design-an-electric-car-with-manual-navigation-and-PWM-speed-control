# Design-an-electric-car-with-manual-navigation-and-PWM-speed-control
Due to the extreme negative effects of gasoline engines on the environment and  people, the automotive industry has shifted to electric cars. This study describes the operation of  an electric car and compares it to internal combustion engines and hybrid car. The research outlines  some of the benefits and drawbacks of electric cars. A brief future picture of the technology is also  provided.

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2><br>
Electric car were needed in the 1960s and 1970s to alleviate the difficulties of internal combustion 
engine exhaust pollution and to lessen reliance on imported foreign crude oil. Many attempts to 
build workable electric cars occurred and continue to occur between 1960 and the present.
The goal of this paper is to outline the technology that goes into making an electric car and to 
demonstrate why an electric engine is superior to an internal combustion engine. It explains why 
the electric car has grown so quickly and why it is now a must for a better future. The study goes 
over the most significant components of an electric or hybrid car. It contrasts electric cars with 
hybrids and internal combustion engines. It also covers the electric car's future. The entire impact 
of the electric car helps individuals in the long run. Electric cars are ninety-seven percent cleaner 
than gasoline-powered cars, with no exhaust emissions that can cause particulate matter to enter 
the air. Particulate matter, a type of carcinogen spewed into the environment by gasoline-powered 
cars, “can aggravate asthma and irritate respiratory systems” [1].
The paper opens with an overview of the electric car's history, including manufacturing lows and 
highs as well as the causes for change. The following section gives a technical overview of an 
electric car, including its components, functions, and operation theory. The hybrid car is described 
in the next section, which includes parts, their roles, and the theory of functioning. I then compare 
the internal combustion engine, hybrid engine, and electric engine in terms of efficiency, speed, 
acceleration, maintenance, mileage, and cost based on this knowledge. The study finishes with 
sections on the benefits and drawbacks of electric cars, as well as their future prospects.

Design an electric car with manual navigation and PWM speed control.
 <br>
Before we have design the car we have made a diagram of it.
